This page contains information about monuments in Glasgow

The top of the site would contain a header with the site's logo and a navbar with the other pages as buttons on the bar

The top of the page would contain a carousel of photos of the top 10 most visited monuments

Below this there would be a grid of images and names of the top monuments and their Trustpilot rating.

When one of either the carousel or the grid elements are clicked the site would take you to a page containing info on that monument (open/closed, cost per ticket, Trustpilot rating, name, location)

The Monument specific page would also contain a quick summary of the monument's history and a link to it's wikipedia page

At the bottom of the site there would be a footer with the pages as links and some info about the licence
